# State and Region Isolation Export Feature

## Overview
This feature will allow users to isolate either a single state (when in county mode) or an entire region (when in state mode) on the map and export it as an image. This enhancement aims to provide users with the ability to focus on specific geographical areas and create visual exports for their needs.

## User Story
As a user, I want to:
- When in county mode: select a single state on the map and generate an image export of that isolated state so that I can export an image of the isolated state
- When in state mode: select a region and generate an image export of that isolated region so that I can export an image of the isolated region
- Have the exported image include the map legend matching the current mode's configuration

## Technical Requirements

### Isolation Functionality
#### State Isolation (County Mode)
- Implement click handling for state selection
- Add visual feedback for the selected state
- Implement a mechanism to de-emphasize or hide other states
- Maintain the geographical context while highlighting the selected state

#### Region Isolation (State Mode)
- Implement region selection mechanism
- Add visual feedback for the selected region
- Implement a mechanism to de-emphasize or hide other regions
- Maintain the geographical context while highlighting the selected region
- Handle the multi-state nature of regions appropriately

### Image Export
- Create an export function to capture the isolated state view
- Generate a high-quality image output
- Provide appropriate image format options (e.g., PNG, JPG)
- Ensure the export maintains the visual styling and quality

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear visual indication of state/region selection
- Intuitive controls for triggering the export
- Smooth transitions when isolating states or regions
- Clear feedback during the export process
- Clear indication of which mode is active (state or region isolation)

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using HTML5 Canvas or SVG for the export functionality
- Evaluate browser compatibility for image export features
- Consider resolution and scaling factors for the exported images
- Implement proper state grouping for regional isolation
- Consider the visual treatment of state borders within a selected region

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple state/region selection capability
- Custom export options (size, format, quality)
- Ability to add labels or annotations before export
- Batch export functionality
- Custom region definition capability

## Questions to Address
- What should be the default export format and resolution?
- Should we maintain the current map zoom level in the export?
- How should we handle state/region labels in the exported image?
- Should we include any additional metadata in the export?
- How should we handle states that span multiple regions?
- Should region isolation automatically adjust the zoom level to fit the entire region?
